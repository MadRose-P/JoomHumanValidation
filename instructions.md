# Annotator Instructions

You will be shown short academic interaction texts from a student’s perspective.

## Task 1: Awareness Assessment
Judge to what extent you (as the student) become aware of unfair manipulation.

- 0: No awareness (submission, self-blame, blind compliance)
- 1: Latent or ambiguous awareness
- 2: Clear awareness (boundary setting, questioning, re-anchoring)

## Task 2: Category Assignment
Only if you selected 1 or 2, choose the manipulation category that best fits.
